# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2024-05-01_

PiPact respects your privacy while keeping the experience transparent and compliant with Pi Network policies.

1. **Information collected.** We collect information you provide directly, such as display names, service descriptions, agreement summaries, and history events. Optional contact details are shared privately between participants.
2. **Authentication.** Pi authentication (via Pi SDK) is used only to verify identity and protect sessions. We do not store Pi credentials.
3. **Payments.** Optional Pi payment intents are created and confirmed manually by users through the Pi SDK. PiPact does not store private keys, does not escrow funds, and does not automate payments.
4. **Usage data.** Basic technical logs (e.g., timestamps, request metadata) may be kept to secure the service and detect abuse.
5. **Data use.** Information is used to display service profiles, track agreement lifecycle events, and derive badges from objective outcomes. No automated scoring or speculative analytics are performed.
6. **Data sharing.** We do not sell personal data. Information may be shared when required by law or to prevent abuse.
7. **Retention.** Data is retained as needed for the purposes above and deleted when no longer necessary or upon valid request, subject to legal obligations.
8. **Your responsibilities.** Keep sensitive details out of public fields. Share private contact info only with trusted parties. You are responsible for the information you publish.
9. **Changes.** We may update this policy. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.

Contact the PiPact team for any privacy questions or requests.
