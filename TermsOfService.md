# Terms of Service

_Last updated: 2024-05-01_

PiPact is a coordination tool for human-to-human service agreements. By using PiPact, you agree to these terms.

1. **No escrow or guarantees.** PiPact does not hold funds, enforce delivery, or guarantee payment. All commitments are between participants.
2. **Eligibility.** You must comply with Pi Network policies and applicable laws. You are responsible for your identity, disclosures, and actions.
3. **Appropriate use.** Do not use PiPact for speculation, trading, staking, yield, or any activity promising returns. Keep all descriptions factual and conservative.
4. **Service profiles.** Profiles must accurately describe services, categories, and contact preferences. Avoid exaggerated claims or unverifiable outcomes.
5. **Agreements.** Agreements document intent only. Status changes are human-driven (`CREATED → ACCEPTED → DELIVERED → (PAID | CLOSED_UNPAID)` and `ACCEPTED → ABANDONED`).
6. **Payments in Pi.** Payments are optional and must be initiated and confirmed manually by participants through the Pi SDK. PiPact never intermediates or escrows value.
7. **Badges.** Badges are derived only from objective events (e.g., completed agreements) and are not ratings or endorsements.
8. **Privacy.** See the Privacy Policy for how we handle information. Keep sensitive data out of public fields and share contact details privately.
9. **Content standards.** All copy must remain in English, neutral, and Pi Network–safe. We may remove content that violates these standards.
10. **Limitation of liability.** PiPact is provided “as is.” You are solely responsible for your agreements and outcomes.
11. **Changes.** These terms may change. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

If you disagree with these terms, do not use PiPact.
